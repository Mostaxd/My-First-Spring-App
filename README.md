# My-First-Spring-App
A simple core-Spring app i made myself after learning the basic concepts of Spring.
it has 2 types of cars (MercedesCar and ToyotaCar).
these cars' engines can be checked and replaced with the help of the interface Engine.

Types of Engines available: MercedesEngine , ToyotaEngine

Usually, the ToyotaCar has a standard ToyotaEngine installed
and the MercedesCar has a standard MercedesEngine.

The Engines of the cars however; can be changed using Setter Injection.

# This App includes:
1- Spring Inversion of Control

2- Spring Dependency Injection

3- Constructor Injection

4- Literal Values inejections

4- Setter Injection
___
i thought about including things like: Injecting Values From a Properties file, adding a Bean Scope, and putting a Bean Lifecycle example.
But found it unneccessary.

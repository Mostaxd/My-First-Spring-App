// ==> Conclusion: This is a good program but its' problem is that it is HARD-Coded. It needs the source code in main
//				   to be changed. Why Can't we make just ONE object Car and change the type of it
//				   using an XML config file to configure which car is it? How about keeping the main function as it is
 * 				   and create objects and set their values externally? 
 * 				   this is called Inversion of Control(IoC) and Field Injection.
